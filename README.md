# Reduxstagram

An Instagram clone made with React and Redux as part of Wes Bos's awesome [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com/) course.

This project is a complete working implementation. Besides the code being completely different, there are other several key differences:

* Project structure and components were separated by domain.

* [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) was used for all UI components.

* Custom styles were separated by component.

* The app was made responsive in order to work on mobile browsers.

* Tests were added using [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

* The app was created using Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool.

* All React, React-Router and Redux dependencies were updated to their latest versions (as of this writing).

* CircleCI was used for continuous testing and deployment.

* The app was deployed to `gh-pages` using a custom script.

Special thanks to [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos) for creating such an informative and engaging course!
